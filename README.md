This project is a task I decided to take on after working on templates for a while. This landing page was designed using HTML and CSS. It took me 2 hours because of the media query. I applied a breakpoint for mobile smartphone. The experience was an interesting one, finally getting confident in the projects I am working on. I am getting familiarized with media queries (by walking down through elements)
